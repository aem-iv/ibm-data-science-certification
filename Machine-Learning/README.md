# AUS Weather Classification**Author:** aem-iv  **Date:** January 2026  ## OverviewThis project predicts whether it will rain **today** using Australian weather data.It applies preprocessing pipelines and compares a Random Forest classifier withLogistic Regression.## DatasetData source:- `weatherAUS-2.csv` (loaded directly via URL)Locations used:- Melbourne- MelbourneAirport- Watsonia## Methodology- Removed missing values- Feature engineering: Date → Season- Stratified train/test split- Preprocessing with scaling and one-hot encoding- Model tuning with GridSearchCV## Models- Random Forest Classifier- Logistic Regression (L1 / L2 regularization)## How to Run```bashpip install -r requirements.txtpython aus_weather_classification.py## NotesThe primary goal is detecting rain events. Accuracy alone is insufficient due toclass imbalance; recall and F1-score should also be considered.
